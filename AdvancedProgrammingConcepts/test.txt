I cast you out, unclean spirit, along with every Hepathic power of the enemy, every spectre from the lower planes, and all your fell companions; in the name of our Lord The Emperor. Begone and stay far from this creature of The Emperor. For it is He who commands you. He who once stilled the sea and the wind and the storm. Hearken, therefore, and tremble in fear, Hepath, you enemy of the faith, you foe of the human race, you begetter of death, you robber of life, you corrupter of justice, you root of all evil and vice; seducer of men, betrayer of the nations, instigator of envy, font of avarice, formentor of discord, author of pain and sorrow. Why, then, do you stand and resist, knowing as you must that The Emperor brings your plans to nothing? Fear Him. Begone, then, in the name of The Emperor. Give place to his Spirit by this sign of the Legion cross of our Lord The Emperor, who lives and reigns within Sanctuary, forever and ever. 

Therefore, I adjure you every unclean spirit, every spectre from the lower planes, every hepathic power, in the name of The Emperor; to quail before wretched man, seeing in him the image of the almighty Emperor, rather than his state of human frailty. Yield then to The Emperor, who by His servant, We, cast you and your malice, into the depths of the lower planes. Yield to The Emperor, who, by the chanting of holy canticles by his faithful servants, banished you from the heart of this man. Yield to The Emperor, who condemned you, the traitor. For He now flails you with His divine scourges, He in whose sight you and your legions once quailed. Now He is driving you back into the everlasting fire, He who at the end of time will say to the wicked: "Depart from me, you accursed, into the everlasting fire which has been prepared for all the denizens of the lower planes." For you, O evil one, and for your followers there will be worms that never die. An unquenchable fire stands ready for you and for your minions, you prince of accursed murderers, father of lechery, instigator of sacrileges, model of vileness, promoter of heresies, inventor of every obscenity. 

Depart, then, impious one, depart, accursed one, depart with all your deceits, for The Emperor has willed that man should be His temple. Why do you still linger here? Give honour to The Emperor the Father almighty, before whom every knee must bow. Give place to the Lord Emperor, who shed His most precious blood for man. Depart and begone.
