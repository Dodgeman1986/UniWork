# Advanced Programming Concepts

## How to run the text processing code

### C# program
### Haskell program
### Test files

----

### C#
  * The C# application 'TextProcessing' requires visual studio 12 and the dotnot framework version 4.
	* Double click the .sln file located in "Pagan-Lodge_J_s0404172_Advance_Concepts_in_Languages\TextProcessing"
	* Once the project has loaded in Visual Studio press F5 to run or the green arrow button
		* The first button 'File to Process' is used to select the text file to be processed
		* The second button 'Transition Word File' is used to selct the transition words text file
		* The third button 'Process' will set the text processing algorithms running
	* This will output the top 10 most common words into the text area below the buttons

### Haskell
  * The Haskell program requires the Haskell Platform to be installed and preferably WinGHCi to run it
  * Run WinGHCi and load TextProcessing.hs
  * Click the run button
  * This will output the top 10 most common words from test.txt into the window	
  * To change the text file to be processed open the TextProcessing.hs file in a text editor, such as Notepad++
  * uncomment line 14, and comment out line 15 to run the text processing on WarAndPeace.txt

----

### Test Files
  * There are 2 text text files that can be used to test these programs
    * test.txt
    * WarAndPeace.txt
  * There is also a text file containg common transition words
    * TransitionWords.txt
